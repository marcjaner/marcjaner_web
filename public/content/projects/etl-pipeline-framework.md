# ETL Pipeline Framework

## Overview

This project is a scalable framework for building and managing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows with comprehensive monitoring and error handling. It provides a standardized approach to data pipeline development, making it easier to create, test, and deploy data integration processes.

## Features

- **Modular Pipeline Architecture**: Easily compose complex workflows from reusable components
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for each step of the ETL process
- **Error Handling & Retry Logic**: Robust error handling with configurable retry policies
- **Data Validation**: Schema validation and data quality checks
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of pipeline status and performance
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker-based deployment for consistent environments

## Technical Details

The framework is built with Python and Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration. It uses Docker for containerization and includes a suite of pre-built connectors for common data sources and destinations.

```python
# Example of a pipeline definition
from etl_framework import Pipeline, tasks

pipeline = Pipeline(
    name="customer_data_integration",
    schedule="0 2 * * *"  # Run daily at 2 AM
)

# Define pipeline tasks
extract = tasks.PostgresExtract(
    connection_id="source_db",
    sql="SELECT * FROM customers WHERE updated_at > '{{ yesterday_ds }}'"
)

transform = tasks.PythonTransform(
    function="transforms.customer_data.clean_and_enrich",
    requirements=["pandas>=1.3.0", "numpy"]
)

load = tasks.S3Load(
    connection_id="data_lake",
    destination="processed/customers/{{ ds }}/data.parquet",
    format="parquet"
)

# Compose the pipeline
pipeline.add_task(extract)
pipeline.add_task(transform, depends_on=[extract])
pipeline.add_task(load, depends_on=[transform])
```

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was designing a framework that was both flexible enough to handle diverse data integration needs while still providing standardized patterns. I solved this by creating a plugin architecture that allows custom components to be easily integrated while maintaining a consistent interface.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for real-time streaming data
- Implement machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Create a visual pipeline builder interface
