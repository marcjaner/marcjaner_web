# Data Visualization Dashboard

## Overview

This project is an interactive dashboard for visualizing complex datasets with customizable charts and filters. It allows users to upload their own data, select visualization types, and customize the appearance of charts.

## Features

- **Data Import**: Support for CSV, JSON, and Excel file formats
- **Multiple Visualization Types**: Bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, pie charts, and more
- **Interactive Filtering**: Filter data dynamically with an intuitive UI
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Export Options**: Download visualizations as PNG, SVG, or PDF
- **Theme Customization**: Light and dark mode with customizable color palettes

## Technical Details

The dashboard is built with React and TypeScript for the frontend, with D3.js handling the data visualization. The application uses a modular architecture that makes it easy to add new visualization types.

```typescript
// Example of the chart component structure
interface ChartProps {
  data: DataPoint[];
  dimensions: { width: number; height: number };
  options: ChartOptions;
}

const BarChart: React.FC<ChartProps> = ({ data, dimensions, options }) => {
  // D3.js implementation
  // ...
};
```

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was handling large datasets without affecting performance. I implemented data sampling and progressive loading techniques to ensure smooth interactions even with millions of data points.

## Future Improvements

- Add machine learning-based data insights
- Implement real-time data streaming support
- Add collaborative features for team analysis
