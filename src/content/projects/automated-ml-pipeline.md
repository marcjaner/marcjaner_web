# Automated ML Pipeline

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline with automated feature engineering and model selection.

## Project Overview

This project provides a framework for automating the machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model deployment. It handles feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model versioning in a reproducible way.

## Features

- Automated feature selection and engineering
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Model selection based on multiple metrics
- ML experiment tracking with MLflow
- API deployment with FastAPI
- Continuous monitoring of model performance

## Technical Implementation

The pipeline integrates various tools to provide a comprehensive solution:

- Python for core implementation
- Scikit-learn for ML algorithms
- MLflow for experiment tracking
- FastAPI for API development
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Results

The automated pipeline has been successfully deployed for several use cases, including customer churn prediction, demand forecasting, and anomaly detection, with significant improvements in model performance and development time.
